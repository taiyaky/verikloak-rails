# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

- Do **not** open a public issue.
- Instead, contact the maintainer privately.
- You may also use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/taiyaky/verikloak/security/advisories) to submit a report.

We will investigate and address vulnerabilities as a priority.
